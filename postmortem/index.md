# Trampofelines - Post mortem

*Looking back at what I made for js13k 2025, what went great and what went wrong*

Here I am, 2 hours before the voting deadline, cobbling together a write up for this little thing I made for a game jam.


## How I got into js13k

js13k 2025 is the very first game jam I ever joined. I've always wanted to participate in a game jam, but I never knew exactly how or when I'd get into it, and the idea of making a game, let alone in so little time, always felt a bit scary. But this summer was a bit special for me, I learned a ton of fancy JavaScript libraries and honed my web dev skills, so the time was quite ripe.

Per usual with most things that I do, I found out about js13k with a very serendipitous click on a link on the web. Three days after the start of the competition, I was looking for ways to make an OCaml program run in the brower. I stumbled upon this blog post (todo: look for the post and credit the guy).

## The idea for the game

The main inspiration for the game is a minigame called [Trampoline Time]() from New Super Mario Bros for the Nintendo DS. In the minigame, you draw trampolines with your stylus to make Mario hop to from one side of the screen to the other, aiming to make him land on the exit doors that open at alternating time intervals.
