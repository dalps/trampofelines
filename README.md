My entry for js13k 2025.

### Acknowledgements

* I used [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) to create the more intricate paths
* The font is [Kurokane by Fontworks](https://lets.fontworks.co.jp/fontworks)
* Sound engine by [ZzFXM](https://keithclark.github.io/ZzFXM/)
* [Roadroller](https://www.npmjs.com/package/roadroller) to compress the code (I wanted to use Google's Closure, but in the end it was too late to adapt my code to its restrictions).
